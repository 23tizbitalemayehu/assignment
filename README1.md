Iterative-and-Recursive-Approach-in-Algorism
An iterative approach uses loops (like for, while, or do-while) to repeatedly execute a block of code until a specific condition is met. On the other hand, a recursive approach solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem, usually through function calls.
Key Differences:
Iteration:
Uses loops to repeat operations.
Generally more memory-efficient because it doesn't use the function call stack.
Easier to debug and maintain for simple problems.
Recursion:
A function calls itself to solve subproblems.
Requires additional memory for the call stack, which could lead to a stack overflow for deep recursion.
Intuitive and elegant for problems like tree traversal or divide-and-conquer algorithms.
